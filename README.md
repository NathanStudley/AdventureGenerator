# AdventureGenerator

The Adventure Generator is a single web application that allows the user to track, plan, and generate random activites to do whenever the time arises! It is a full stack development that implements database management via MongoDB Atlas.


For personal use, clone this repository on your local machine and set up the [database.js](server/database.js) file with your personal MongoDB database url and whitelist your IP address. Then use the `npm start` command to run the express server locally.
